- Gravity forms datepicker? File upload?
- A search page
- Create/Refine the search component with more detailed gatsby graphql query
- Setup hotkey search as an example of progressive enhancement
- Provide an example of rendering a page with "content" (Maybe parsed content);
- Setup a default react Swiper component? (Although swiper is really just a wrapper around your other components; not really a dedicated need for one; )
